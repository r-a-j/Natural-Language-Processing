    "Sentiment analysis is widely used in NLP, but **achieving high accuracy is difficult**.  \n",
    "- Why do machine learning models struggle with sentiment analysis?  \n",
    "- What are some approaches to **improve sentiment classification**?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer**\n",
    "‚úÖ **Why Sentiment Analysis is Difficult**:\n",
    "1. **Sarcasm & Irony**  \n",
    "   - \"Oh great, my flight got canceled. Best day ever!\"  \n",
    "   - Model might classify this as **positive** instead of **negative**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Negation Handling**  \n",
    "   - \"This movie is **not bad**.\"  \n",
    "   - Some models may classify it as **negative** due to \"bad\", but humans understand it's positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Sensitivity**  \n",
    "   - \"The acting was great, but the storyline was horrible.\"  \n",
    "   - Mixed sentiment is **hard for a simple model** to classify correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Domain-Specific Sentiments**  \n",
    "   - \"This phone has a lot of weight.\"  \n",

    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **How to Improve Sentiment Classification**:\n",
    "1. **Use Context-Aware Models**  \n",
    "   - Transformers like **BERT** capture **context**, unlike simple classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incorporate Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**  \n",
    "   - Instead of a **single sentiment**, classify sentiment **for each feature** (e.g., **\"Camera is great, but battery is bad\"**).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Sarcasm Detection Models**  \n",
    "   - Fine-tune models using **sarcastic tweets**, which often contain **contradictory emotions**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Answer**\n",
    "‚úÖ **Why Hallucinations Occur**:\n",
    "1. **Lack of Factual Grounding**  \n",
    "   - LLMs **predict the next word based on probabilities**, **not truth**.\n",
    "   - If a model has seen **fake news**, it might repeat **misinformation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outdated Training Data**  \n",
    "   - Example: \"Who is the President of the US?\"  \n",
    "   - A model trained in **2021** might say **\"Joe Biden\"**, even in **2025**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overgeneralization & Pattern Matching**  \n",
    "   - \"The Eiffel Tower is located in **Italy**.\"  \n",
    "   - If the model **associates \"Eiffel\" with \"European landmarks\"**, it might **guess incorrectly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **How to Reduce Hallucinations**:\n",
    "1. **Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  \n",
    "   - Instead of **relying only on training data**, allow the model to **fetch real-time documents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train Models on Fact-Checked Data**  \n",
    "   - Use **verified sources** like **Wikipedia, news agencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**  \n",
    "   - Ask humans to **correct false outputs** and fine-tune **based on feedback**.\n",

    "   - If a model is **trained only on political news**, it will **struggle** with health or finance misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **How to Improve Fake News Detection**:\n",
    "1. **Combine Text & Source Verification**  \n",
    "   - Use **NLP + external databases** (e.g., FactCheck.org) to **verify claims**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Stylometric Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Fake news often has **exaggerated words**, **sensational phrases**, and **unverified claims**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Check News with Ground Truth**  \n",
